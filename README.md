# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Introduction
This is the documentation about Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a crucial stage in software development where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified and documented.

This phase ensures that the development team clearly understands what the software should achieve and the specific conditions it must meet. Thoroughly gathering and analyzing requirements at the start helps avoid misunderstandings and reduces the likelihood of costly changes later in development.

The requirements are typically categorized into two types: functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

Functional Requirements: These define the specific actions the software must be able to perform. Functional requirements focus on the core features and operations that the system needs to support.
Example: For an online banking application, a functional requirement might be: “The system must allow users to transfer funds between accounts.”
Non-Functional Requirements: Unlike functional requirements, non-functional requirements address the quality and performance of the system. They include criteria such as speed, security, scalability, and user experience, and describe how the system should perform under various conditions.
Example: A non-functional requirement for the same banking system might be: “The application should be able to handle 1,000 transactions per minute without performance issues.”
Both functional and non-functional requirements are vital for ensuring that the software not only fulfills its intended tasks but also performs efficiently and meets user expectations. Properly defining these requirements upfront helps guide the development process, leading to a more successful project outcome.

## Importance of Requirment Analysis
Requirement Analysis is arguably the most critical phase of the SDLC. Its importance cannot be overstated, as the success or failure of a project often hinges on how well this stage is executed.
1. **Forms the Foundation for the Entire Project**
  The requirements document (like the SRS) is the blueprint for the entire project. It guides the work of designers, developers, testers, and project managers. A solid foundation leads to a stable structure; a weak one guarantees problems down the line.
2. **Aligns the Final Product with Business Goals**
  The process ensures that the software being built actually solves the right business problem and delivers tangible value to the organization. It bridges the gap between the vague business needs of the stakeholders and the technical specifications needed by the developers.
3. **Reduces Costs and Rework**
  Fixing a requirement error during the coding phase is up to 10 times more expensive than fixing it during the analysis phase. Fixing the same error after release can be up to 100 times more expensive. Thorough analysis catches misunderstandings and errors early, when they are cheapest and easiest to correct.
4. **Manages Scope and Prevents "Scope Creep"**
  A well-defined and approved requirements document acts as a contract between the development team and the client. It sets clear boundaries for what will and will not be delivered in a given timeframe or budget, helping to manage expectations and prevent uncontrolled changes ("scope creep") that can derail a project.
5. **Enables Accurate Estimation and Planning**
  With clear requirements, project managers can better estimate the time, resources, and budget needed for development and testing. This leads to more realistic project plans and schedules.
6. **Provides a Basis for Testing and Quality Assurance**
  Test cases are derived directly from the requirements. A clear, testable requirement allows QA teams to create precise tests to verify that the software functions as intended. Without this, testing becomes subjective and incomplete.
7. **Improves Communication and Stakeholder Satisfaction**
  The process fosters continuous communication between the technical team and non-technical stakeholders. This shared understanding minimizes surprises at the end of the project and ensures the final product is what the stakeholders expected, leading to higher satisfaction and adoption.
